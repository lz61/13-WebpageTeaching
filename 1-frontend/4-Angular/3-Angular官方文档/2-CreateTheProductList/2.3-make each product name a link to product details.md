## 2.3-make each product name a link to product details

**content**

1.To make each product name a link to product details, add the 

`<a>` element around `{{product.name}}`



2.Set the title to be the product's name by using the property binding symbol(中括号):

```
[ ]
```

syntax, as follows:

```
...
  <h3>
    <a [title]="product.name + ' details' ">
      {{ product.name }}
    </a>
  </h3>
...
```

**What the [title] does:**

when your mouse is onto the element, the [title] shows things on the "="'s right, in this case,

```
product.name + ' details'
```



**Expected Result:**

In the preview pane, hover over a product name to see the bound name property value, which is the product name plus the word "details". Property binding `[ ]` lets you use the property value in a template expression.
